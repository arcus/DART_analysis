## Study design

The DART program is efficient, targetted data science education for
biomedical researchers. We provide a tailored pathway of learning
“modules” designed to match each learners’ current expertise,
professional needs, and interest, and also supported an online Community
of Practice to give learners the opportunity to work collaboratively and
network. We ran DART twice, each for 16 weeks.

We assessed the effectiveness of DART by measuring self-report data
science ability and agreement with important tenets of open science both
before and after the program. There’s no control group. We used
hierarchical clustering to identify groups of learners with similar
educational needs and built a pathway for each; pathway is treated as a
random effect in the models to account for that grouping structure.
