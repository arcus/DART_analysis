# Proposed pathways for DART Wave 2

For each cluster described here, there are three plots at the beginning showing the **topics in the order that cluster rated them** from highest to lowest for each of current expertise, relevance to work, and desire to learn.

We want to select modules for each cluster that will meet their learning needs and goals, as shown in the highest rated topics for learn and relevance, and are a good fit for their current level of expertise.  

Note: The plots in this report are generated by `explore_clusters.rmd`.

**Wondering about the exact wording of the questions?** 
Check out the [needs assessment](https://github.com/arcus/education_dart_recruitment_comms/blob/main/surveys/needs_assessment/instrument.csv) in the surveys directory on our comms repo. 
(Note that this instrument includes items from wave 1 that weren't shown to wave 2 participants -- the last column indicates which items were hidden. Wave 2 saw from `data_viz` to `learn_data_science`.)

Useful references: 

- our wave 1 pathways, as examples:  https://github.com/arcus/DART_wave1_analysis/blob/main/reports/notebooks/proposed_pathways.md
- a list of all our current modules with times: https://github.com/arcus/NALMS_Not_Another_LMS/blob/main/module_time.txt

## Modules for everyone

The only universal module is reproducibility, because we want to use that to set the tone for everyone.

Learning to learn and how to troubleshoot will be included for beginners, but not more experienced learners.

## Some questions to consider

- Did I spell flower names wrong? I am a terrible speller. 

## Cluster 1

One of our more "unconvinced" clusters. Low expertise on most topics except data viz, text and stats (all ~2). Seem to be new to programming (mostly 1s on R, python, SQL, and bash).

Medium relevance on most topics; they might be working mostly on non-data science research questions currently and trying to figure out if/how to approach data science. Generally pretty high relevance on learn data science (~4), though, as well as data viz, text, stats, and database. 

### Modules they might like

![](explore_clusters_w2_files/figure-gfm/rank_topics-12.png)

This is one of the most distinct clusters (it appears high in the hierarchical tree).
Generally low-ish expertise except for reproducibility (3-4), stats (~3), and data viz (~3). These might be people with training in tools we don't teach (e.g. Stata, SAS).
They're showing strong enthusiasm for reproducible methods now though! 

Very high relevance for reproducibility, learn data science ("Figure out which data science techniques and tools will be most useful in your research"), data viz, stats. 
High relevance for omics, data sharing, R, data cleaning. 

Very high interest in learning R (expertise ~2, but several 1's as well), stats (~3 expertise), data viz, and learn_data_science (expertise 1-3). 
High interest in data cleaning, ML, omics, and data sharing.
High-ish interest on pretty much everything else. 

### Modules they might like

- R sequence, probably include intro
- data viz in R
- demystifyings on a bunch of different topics
- stats
- containers (for reproducibility)?

This is one of the most distinct clusters (it appears high in the hierachical tree).
A small cluster (n=4), and they're absolute beginners! 1's on everything for expertise (although remember we impute 1 for missing values on this instrument, so some of these may be true 1's and some could have been left blank).
Also 1's on learn for everything! We've got relevance info to work with, though.

This is an enthusastic group. :) They rate almost every topic as 5 for both relevance and learn (except bash, sorry bash). 
Medium-high to medium expertise on most topics, but less so on programming skills: R is pretty evenly spread 1-4, SQL and bash 1-3, and python is mostly 1s. 
Either they're used to working with other programming tools (e.g. Stata, Matlab) or they're pretty new to programming. 
They rate themselves higher expertise on reproducibility, data cleaning, database, SDH, data viz, data sharing, and learn data science. 
Most have at least some experience with text, stats, R, and geospatial. 

High interest in learning almost everything, but especially learn data science, stats, data viz, data clean, git, reproducible, and data sharing.

Medium-high expertise across the board, very few 1's for expertise, plenty of 4's and 5's. 
Especially high in data cleaning, SQL, and reproducibility.

git shows up quite high for relevance, as does SQL, stats, data viz, and data cleaning. 

High interest in learning most things, especially stats (expertise is mostly 2-4 on stats), data viz (expertise 3-4), ML (expertise ~3), data cleaning (expertise 4-5), reproducibility (expertise ~4), python (expertise 3-4), and omics (expertise 2-3). 

This is a group that would probably like some modules we don't have ready, especially non-intro stats and ML content.

Medium high expertise (3-4) on many topics, especially SDH, text, stats, reproducibility, data viz and data cleaning. 

Mediumish relevance on most topics. 

Very interested in learning git (expertise ~3)! 
Also data viz (expertise ~3)! 
Also almost everything else :) 

As to programming languages, R seems like the way to go (expertise 2-3 ish, vs python which has a lot of 1's). R relevance is on the low side, though (mostly 1-3), so good idea to start with the basics.

![](explore_clusters_w2_files/figure-gfm/rank_topics-48.png)

Mostly low expertise except reproducible, stats, and data viz (~3). 
As to languages, R expertise spread 1-4, SQL split pretty evenly between 1s and 3s, bash 1-3, python mostly 1s. 

High relevance only for stats, reproducibility, data viz, and data cleaning; maybe they're used to working in other stats software. 

This is a group who knows what they want! Very high interest in learning stats, R, SQL, data viz, ML, and slightly less so python (mostly 5's but a couple 1s and 3s). So let's give them that!

### Modules they might like

- all the stats
- all the R (probably start with intro) including data viz
- all the SQL
- all the python (start with demystifying) including data viz
- demystifying ML

This is one of the most distinct clusters (it appears high in the hierachical tree).
Generally low expertise, but medium-low on data cleaning, stats, data viz, and reproducibility.

Very high relevance on almost everything, and rated almost everything a 5 for desire to learn, bless them. 

Because R is rated as higher relevance for most of them than python, let's start there. 
If we're looking to fill space in their pathway, they may be good ones for the regex sequence, too, since a sizeable minority of them report > 1 expertise with text.

### Modules they might like

- R stuff, starting with basics
- demystifyings

Pretty low expertise on most topics. More R than python, but it's still mostly 1s. 

High relevance for text and database (maybe EHR folks?), also data cleaning. 

High interest in database, data cleaning, R, and text.

This is a very small cluster (just 4 people), and pretty distinct (it appears back when we split from 12 to 13 clusters). 

They have high R expertise (~5), also high stats, omics, bash, and data viz.
Low experience only really on text, SDH and citizen science. 

All 5's for relevance for omics, and 4-5 for R relevance; these appear to be experienced omics researchers, and they use R. They're split on bash (three of them have 5's for relevance and expertise, the other has a 2 for relevance and 3 for expertise). 

Very interested in learning text (expertise 1-2)! 
And SQL (expertise is spread on this 2-5), python, and ML. 
Some interest in git (expertise ~3, learn is mostly 4 and 5), so maybe put that content in if we need to fill space.

### Modules they might like

- regex, definitely
- SQL
- more advanced python
- ML
- maybe git sequence

### tulip pathway (935 mins)
This group could be one that flies through their content based on incoming expertise ratings, so if we want to pad their numbers to be even higher, we could possibly add a More to explore at the end that gives them a bunch of demystifying-type content of a variety of things that perhaps they don't have interest in learning at a deep level, but might enjoy learning more about it shallowly? 

#### Reproducibility (140 mins)
( I know these folks didn't necessarily rank reproducibility as something they want to learn more about/ already ranked themselves as high expertise, _but_ I think it's possible that they could be high on reproducibility and still not yet be using containerization, depending on how they interpret our question? )

## About deciding on the clustering solution

The hierarchical clustering analysis produces one hierarchical tree, where each individual participant is their own group at the bottom and everyone is lumped into one group at the top (so the tree is upside down, I guess).

![](define_clusters_files/figure-gfm/ward-1.png)

You can "cut" the tree horizontally at any point going up the y-axis; a lower cut will give you more groups, and a higher cut will give you fewer groups.
As you move higher, the lower groups come together to form the higher groups (the structure is hierarchical).
So you might cut the tree to give you four groups, A, B, C, and D, but if you cut it lower to get five groups then one of the previous ones will split into two --- maybe group C splits, so now you have A, B, C1, C2, and D.
Groups split and merge as you go up and down, but participants never jump from one branch to another.

I explored solutions with 4-20 clusters. 
I didn't want to go above 20 clusters because 1) an average of 20 people per cluster is sort of the lowest I'm willing to go in terms of statistical power, and 2) designing more than 20 pathways feels like too big of a lift to get done in a couple days. 

I was looking at the groups generated by each solution and seeing how well I could fit them to our available modules.
I checked the solution above and below to see if splitting or merging groups made it easier to define pathways.

**tldr** I landed on the 19-group solution; if you go down to a 18-group solution it combines clusters 11 and 13, which feel distinct enough to me to need different pathways (especially since 13 seems like they'd benefit from the R and git sequences, and 11 not so much). If you go up to 20 groups, it splits cluster 12 but those two groups don't seem to have really distinct needs.
